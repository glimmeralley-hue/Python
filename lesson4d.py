# Python while loop.
#  While loop executes a block of code repeatedly as long as a certain condition is true. The syntax of a while loop in python is as follows:
"""
initialization of a variable,
while keyword,
followed by the condition/statement to be evaluated,
followed by a full colon(:),
code to be printed out,
increment/decrement
"""

#number=0
#while number < 65764654564745465465465:
   # print("hello dyllan", number)
   # number= number + 1

print('==============================')
# create a python program that prints the even numbers from 50 to 70 using while loop
number=50
while number < 71:
         print(number)
         number= number + 2

print('==============================')
#below is a decrement example that prints multiples of 3 starting from 201 to 150
number=201
while number > 150:
         print(number)
         number= number - 3 

print('==============================')
#below is an infinite loop example
"""number=1
while number > 0:
         print(number)
         number= number + 1"""
