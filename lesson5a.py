# python functions
# they are a block of code/statements that perform a given task/action.they can be reused throughout the program to perform different tasks.
# functions are defined using the def keyword(define) followed by the function name and parentheses. the code block within every function starts with a colon (:) and is indented.
# we havet two main types:
#1. in-built functions: they come pre-installed with the interpreter i.e print().pop(),range(),append()
#2. user-defined functions: they are created by a programmer to solve a given task 
# to define a function we give it a name followed by parentheses
# for the function body,it is usually indented and to invoke a function we use the function name.
